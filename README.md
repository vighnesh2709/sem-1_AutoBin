#Description:
This is a smart dustbin which uses two HCSR-04 ultrasonic sensor one to detect the distance of object so as to open and close if the object is within 10cm. The other HCSR-04 ultrasonic sensor is placed on the inside of the bin to check how much it is filled, the percentage/10 value is displayed on 7 segment led display placed on the front of the box for users to know wheather the bin is full or not.
This dustbin is very efficient product and allows contactless waste disposal, facilitating towards a better human health and hygiene.
